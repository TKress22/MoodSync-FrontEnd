# Welcome to MoodSync!

MoodSync is built using an ASP.NET Api backend that can be found (https://moodsync.azurewebsites.net/),  and an Angular front end that can be found at (https://moodsync1150.herokuapp.com) This project was built with a three person team of developers (Lisa Kilgore, Trever Kress, and Jon Perkins at [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://www.elevenfifty.org/) in Fishers, Indiana.

# MoodSync App Purpose

MoodSync will allow a user to create and listen to playlists based on their "mood", or they can listen to pre-generated playlists that correspond to existing moods.
